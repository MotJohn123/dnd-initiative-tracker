# 🎯 New Features & Improvements

## ✅ Implemented Features (Latest Update)

### 1. 👥 Group Management System
**Problem**: Could only create groups, not edit or delete them.

**Solution**: Full CRUD operations for player groups
- ✏️ **Edit Groups**: Click "Edit" button on any group to modify name and characters
- 🗑️ **Delete Groups**: Click "Delete" button to remove groups (with confirmation)
- 🖼️ **Image URLs**: Add/edit character image URLs in the group form
- ➕ **Dynamic Members**: Add or remove characters while editing

**How to Use**:
1. Go to DM Dashboard → Player Groups section
2. Click "✏️ Edit" on any group to modify it
3. Click "🗑️ Delete" to remove a group (confirmation required)

### 2. ⏰ 8-Hour Auto-Expiration System
**Problem**: Battles would stay active indefinitely, cluttering the system.

**Solution**: Automatic battle expiration with manual refresh
- 🕐 **Auto-End**: Battles automatically end after 8 hours of inactivity
- 🔄 **Refresh Timer**: DM can extend battle by 8 more hours with one click
- 🧹 **Auto-Cleanup**: Expired battles are automatically deactivated on next API call

**How to Use**:
1. When a battle is active, a "🕐 +8 Hours" button appears in the battle controls
2. Click it to extend the battle expiration by 8 hours
3. Confirmation alert shows "Battle extended by 8 hours!"
4. System automatically deactivates battles older than their expiration time

**Technical Details**:
- New field: `expiresAt` (Date) in Battle model
- Default: 8 hours from battle creation
- Auto-cleanup runs on each `/api/battles/active` call
- Refresh endpoint: `PUT /api/battles/:id` with `{ refreshExpiration: true }`

### 3. 🎮 Multi-Battle Selector (for Multiple DMs)
**Problem**: If two DMs start battles simultaneously, players could only see one.

**Solution**: Battle selection system for players
- 📋 **Battle List**: When no battle selected, shows all active battles
- 🎯 **Battle Selector**: Dropdown menu appears when 2+ battles are active
- 🔄 **Dynamic Switching**: Players can switch between active battles in real-time
- 👤 **Smart Default**: Authenticated DMs see their own battle first

**How to Use**:
1. **For Players**: If multiple battles are active, you'll see:
   - A dropdown menu at the top to select which battle to watch
   - Or a list of battle buttons to choose from initially
2. **For DMs**: Your battle is automatically shown to you
3. **API Support**: Pass `?id=battleId` to `/api/battles/active` to select specific battle

**Technical Details**:
- API now returns `availableBattles` array with all active battles
- Player page stores selected battle ID in state
- URL parameter support: `/api/battles/active?id=<battleId>`
- Auto-expiration filter ensures only valid battles are shown

## 🏗️ Architecture Updates

### Is the System Ready for Multiple Battles?
**✅ YES!** The architecture fully supports multiple simultaneous battles:

1. **Database Design**: 
   - Each battle has a `userId` field linking it to the DM
   - MongoDB can handle unlimited concurrent battles
   - Battles are independent documents with no conflicts

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - All battle operations are user-scoped (JWT authentication)
   - Active battle endpoint supports battle selection via query parameter
   - No shared state between battles

3. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Each battle polls independently (500ms refresh)
   - SWR caching prevents conflicts
   - Players can watch different battles simultaneously in different tabs

4. **Scalability**:
   - Serverless functions (Vercel) scale automatically
   - MongoDB Atlas free tier supports multiple concurrent connections
   - No hard limits on number of active battles

### Data Flow Example (2 DMs, 1 Player)
```
DM 1 (User A) → Creates Battle A → MongoDB → Players can select Battle A
DM 2 (User B) → Creates Battle B → MongoDB → Players can select Battle B

Player visits site:
  → API returns: { battle: null, availableBattles: [A, B] }
  → Player selects Battle A
  → API returns full Battle A data
  → Player can switch to Battle B anytime
```
