## üöÄ Step 1: Set Up MongoDB Atlas (2 minutes)

### Why MongoDB Atlas?
- **100% Free** - No credit card required
- **500MB storage** - More than enough for this app
- **Vercel-compatible** - Works perfectly with free hosting

### Setup Steps:

1. **Go to** https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. **Sign up** with your email (or Google/GitHub account)
3. **Create a cluster**:
   - Choose "M0 FREE" tier
   - Pick any cloud provider and region (doesn't matter)
   - Click "Create Cluster"

4. **Create a database user**:
   - Go to "Database Access" in the left menu
   - Click "Add New Database User"
   - Choose "Password" authentication
   - Username: `dnduser` (or anything you like)
   - Password: Click "Autogenerate Secure Password" and **SAVE IT**
   - User Privileges: "Atlas admin"
   - Click "Add User"

5. **Allow network access**:
   - Go to "Network Access" in the left menu
   - Click "Add IP Address"
   - Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (or add `0.0.0.0/0`)
   - Click "Confirm"

6. **Get your connection string**:
   - Go back to "Database" in the left menu
   - Click "Connect" on your cluster
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string (it looks like):
     ```
     mongodb+srv://dnduser:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```
   - **Important**: Replace `<password>` with your actual password!

---

## üîß Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Open** the `.env.local` file in this folder
2. **Replace** the placeholders with your values:

```env
# Paste your MongoDB connection string here (replace <password> with your actual password)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://dnduser:YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/dnd-tracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Generate a random secret (or use this one for testing)
JWT_SECRET=super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production-make-it-long

# Keep this as-is for local development
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. **Save** the file

---

## üéÆ Step 3: Run the Application

Open your terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

## üåê Deploy to Vercel (Free Hosting)

Want to host this online so players can access it from anywhere?

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "D&D Initiative Tracker"
# Create a new repository on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/dnd-tracker.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign up (free)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Add these environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Your secret key
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Leave empty (Vercel will set it automatically)
5. Click "Deploy"

**Done!** Share your Vercel URL with your players!

Every time you push to GitHub, Vercel automatically updates your site.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to database"
- Check your `.env.local` file
- Make sure you replaced `<password>` with your actual password
- Verify you added `0.0.0.0/0` to Network Access in MongoDB Atlas

### "Port 3000 is already in use"
```bash
# Use a different port:
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Need to reset everything?
```bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall:
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```
